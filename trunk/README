How to use the build file ?
===========================

This is a four step tutorial

1. Creating the required directory structure
--------------------------------------------

Under the root folder of your extension you must
have the following directory structure :

::

    myextension
      `-- ant
        `-- myextension.properties

You have to replace "myextension" by the name of your
extension. And the content of the properties file must
be the following :

::

    myextension.version.major     = 1
    myextension.version.minor     = 0
    myextension.version.release   = 0Alpha1
    myextension.svn.url           = http://url/to/your/svn/repository

For example, for the ezoe extension, you should get this :

::

    ezoe
      `-- ant
        `-- ezoe.properties

And the ezoe.properties

::

    ezoe.version.major     = 5
    ezoe.version.minor     = 1
    ezoe.version.release   = 0Alpha1
    ezoe.svn.url           = http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezoe/trunk/ezoe/

If your extension contains a package.xml file, then you also need to
provide the following properties with the version of eZ Publish you
want you package.xml be built against

::

    ezp.version.major   = X
    ezp.version.minor   = Y
    ezp.version.release = Z


2. Downloading the bootstrap file
---------------------------------

Just download bootstrap.xml and store it in the
root folder of your extension

3. Launching the bootstrap file
-------------------------------

::

    ant -f bootstrap.xml

4. Launching the final build
-----------------------------

::

    ant all -Dextension.name=yourextension

run

::

    ant -p

to get a list of all available targets
