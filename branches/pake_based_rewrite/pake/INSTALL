How to install and use eZ Extension Builder
===========================================

This is a 4 steps tutorial.

1. Download the pakefile script
-------------------------------

Usually you would run the build script in root directory of your extension,
but that is not a strict prerequisite. ::

    wget http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezextensionbuilder/stable/pake/pakefile.php


2. Launch the pakefile script for the first time
------------------------------------------------

The script is able to bootstrap, ie. to download all missing components the
first time that you run it: ::

    php pakefile.php

This will create a directory ./pake/ and download all needed stuff into it from http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezextensionbuilder.


3. Edit the configuration file
------------------------------

A sample configuration file is provided by the extension: ./pake/options-sample.yaml
You should copy it to ./pake/options-myextension.yaml and edit it to suit your needs.
Note that steps 1 to 3 have to be executed only once.


4. Launch the final build
-------------------------

To get a list of all available tasks run::

    php pakefile.php --tasks

To build your extension run::

    php pakefile.php build myextension

NB: every time the extension is built, a fresh version is retrieved from its
svn/github repository. The local copy is not used at all.

NB: The Zeta Components library must be available in your php include_path. If it
is not, you can set the environment variable PHP_CLASSPATH to make it available
to the script.
