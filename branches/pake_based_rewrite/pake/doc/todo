. document the crazed file layout of this extension

. test .gitignore file

. add auto-update task to std build task?

. allow extension to build self

. switch to an ini-file based configuration instead of yaml? advantages:
  - easier options parsing, everything is on 2 levels
  - pake code holds options instead of our class

. add support for different dir schemas for extensions providing packages? nb: better if we can do it without that...

. add some detailed documentation of expected standards / task execution


# new tasks

. add a task to generate .sql files from .dba

. add some code quality checks (possibly from other extensions)

. add support for building packages?

. add support for building dependent extensions

. add support for launching testsuite


# improve tasks

. add support for generating more docs:
  . manual from doxygen
  . api docs from phpdocumentor

. sql file check: more flexible naming of sql files (how?)
