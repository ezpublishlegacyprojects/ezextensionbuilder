# general

. allow extension to build self:
  - currently it replaces tokens within pakefile.php files
  - it should build the zip used on the website for auto-upgrades (besides the full zip), or
  - improve upgrade task not to need a separate zip (see description later)  

. allow to build many extensions in a single call
  (workaround: use extension dependencies with a fake 'root' extension)

. add support for different dir schemas for extensions providing packages? nb: better if we can do it without that...

. add more detailed documentation of expected coding/file layouts standards / existing tasks undertakings

. investigate proper usage of phar archives instead of using crazy bootstrap/upgrade processes

. add a 2nd "build env" config file, where paths to tools such as doxygen can be set
  (keep this config file to the main "project" config file)

. move all the business logic in php classes outside of pakefile


# new tasks

. add a task to generate .sql files from .dba

. add some code quality checks (possibly from other extensions)
  - validity of php files
  - proper php opening tag for ini files, absence of charset tag (or only utf8 recommended)
  - proper naming of ini files
  - php coding style
  - css validation (via w3.org validator? see http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/api.html)
  - translation checking (see eg. checks done in ez 4.5 cli script)

. add metrics-generating task (via appropriate php tool)

. add support for building packages (both ez and pear)

. add support for launching testsuite tests

. changelog generation task: if it's not there, build it from git/svn commit messages

. deployment task (eg. to upload extension to projects.ez.no)
  - might need first some changes on projects.ez.no site

. a task that checks for presence of update sql scripts (needs to have access to previous version sources too)

. css/js minification task

. add an apply-patch task to apply patch files at build time

. add tasks to generate sample ezinfo.php and extension.xml files

# improve tasks

. add auto-update task to std build tasks, except when using --skip-upgrade-check option (?)

. init task that starts with a file untar

. bootstrap task forces us to create a 2nd zip besides the main one. Remove the need for this (eg. put url to complete zip in source file and extract it to download full bundle instead of a customized bundle)

. add support for generating more docs:
  . manual from docbook
  . api docs from phpdocumentor and/or docblox besides doxygen
  . rst docs in other dirs?

. show-properties task: show all of them, not just two

. dist task: allow to specify .tar.bz2 output format

. bootstrap: download+install the ezc lib if needed

. clean task: allow to only delete extension dir, not complete build dir

. update-extra-files: also use EXTENSION_NAME and EXTENSION_COPYRIGHT tokens

. allow username/password for svn/git tasks

. do not package package.xml file in zip/tgz

. when updating package.xml, update changelog entries from changelog files in the extension
