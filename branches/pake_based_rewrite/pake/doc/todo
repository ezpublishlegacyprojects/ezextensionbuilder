. support auto-update of the tool (two tasks: upgrade-check and upgrade)

. more flexible naming of sql files (how?)

. allow extension to build self

. add a task to generate .sql files from .dba

. add some code quality checks (possibly from other extensions)

. switch to an ini-file based configuration instead of yaml? advantages:
  - easier options parsing, everything is on 2 levels
  - pake code holds options instead of our class

. add support for building packages?

. add support for different dir schemas for extensions providing packages? nb: better if we can do it without that...

. add support for building dependent extensions

. add support for generating more docs:
  . manual from doxygen
  . api docs from phpdocumentor

. add support for launching testsuite
