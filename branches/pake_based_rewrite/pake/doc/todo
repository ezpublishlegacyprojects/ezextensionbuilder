# general

. allow extension to build self (currently it replaces tokens within pakefile.php files)

. allow to build many extensions in a single call
  (workaround: use extension dependencies with a fake 'root' extension)

. add support for different dir schemas for extensions providing packages? nb: better if we can do it without that...

. add more detailed documentation of expected coding/file layouts standards / existing tasks undertakings

. investigate proper usage of phar archives instead of using crazy bootstrap/upgrade processes


# new tasks

. add a task to generate .sql files from .dba

. add translation checking task (see eg. checks done in ez 4.5 cli script)

. add some code quality checks (possibly from other extensions)
  - validity of php files
  - proper php opening tag for ini files, absence of charset tag (or only utf8 recommended)
  - proper naming of ini files
  - php coding style
  - css validation (via w3.org validator? see http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/api.html)

. add metrics-generating task (via appropriate php tool)

. add support for building packages (?)

. add support for launching testsuite tests

. changelog generation task: if it's not there, build it from git/svn commit messages

. deployment task (eg. to upload extension to projects.ez.no)
  - might need first some changes on projects.ez.no site

# improve tasks

. add auto-update task to std build task, except when using --skip-upgrade-check option (?)

. init task that starts with a file untar

. tool-upgrade task can only upgrade pakefile itself, not all of the tool. To be fixed
  - also bootstrap task forces us to create a 2nd zip besides the main one. Remove the need for this (eg. put url to complete zip in source file and extract it to download full bundle instead of a customized bundle)
  - also remove options-ezextensionbuilder.yaml from bootstrap zip, to make it easier to run the extension with no given target name

. add support for generating more docs:
  . manual from docbook
  . api docs from phpdocumentor and/or docblox besides doxygen
  . rst docs in other dirs?

. check-sql-files task: more flexible naming of sql files (how?)

. show-properties task: show all of them, not just two

. dist task: allow to specify .tar.bz2 output format

. bootstrap: download+install the ezc lib if needed

. clean task: allow to only delete extension dir, not complete build dir

. update-extra-files: also use EXTENSION_NAME and EXTENSION_COPYRIGHT tokens
