. add a warning: tar archive not working on windows with ezc version <= xxx

. test .gitignore file

. allow to build many extensions in a single call

. allow extension to build self

. switch to an ini-file based configuration instead of yaml? advantages:
  - easier options parsing, everything is on 2 levels
  - pake code holds options instead of our class

. add support for different dir schemas for extensions providing packages? nb: better if we can do it without that...

. add some detailed documentation of expected coding/file layouts standards / existing tasks undertakings

. investigate proper usage of phar archives instead of using crazy bootstrap/upgrade processes


# new tasks

. add a task to generate .sql files from .dba

. add translation checking task (see checks done in ez 4.5 cli script)

. add some code quality checks (possibly from other extensions)
  - validity of php files
  - proper php opening tag for ini files, absence of charset tag (or only utf8 recommended)
  - proper naming of ini files
  - php coding style

. add support for building packages?

. add support for building dependent extensions

. add support for launching testsuite tests

. changelog generation task: if it's not there, build it from git/svn commit messages


# improve tasks

. add auto-update task to std build task, except when using --skip-upgrade-check option (?)

. init task that start with a file untar

. allow better specification of files.to_parse and files.to_exclude:
  - allow a file in any dir or a file in a specific dir

. upgrade task can only upgrade pakefile itself, not all of the tool. Fix this

. add support for generating more docs:
  . manual from doxygen
  . api docs from phpdocumentor
  . rst docs in other dirs?

. sql file check: more flexible naming of sql files (how?)

. show properties: show all of them, not just two

. dist task: allow to specify .tar.bz2 output format

. bootstrap: download the ezc if needed

. clean task: allow to only delete extension dir, not complete build dir
